oshu
====
To play with oshu you need an osu beatmap which you can search and download
from https://bloodcat.com/osu and select "Standard" in the Mode section of
the search filter.

The beatmap pack downloaded has the extension .osz but is a zip in disguise
so you can extract it (it's recommendable to put the beatmaps in diferent
directories):
$ mkdir my-beatmap && cd my-beatmap
$ mv ~/Downloads/beatmap-pack.osz .
$ unzip beatmap.osz

After that you can start an .osu file with oshu:
$ oshu beatmap-1.osu

To change the resolution you can set OSHU_WINDOW_SIZE to your monitor
resolution or resize the window manually:
$ export OSHU_WINDOW_SIZE=1920x1080

For more information about the parameters, controls, etc. read oshu(1)
